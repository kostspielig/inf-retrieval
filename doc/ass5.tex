\chapter{Context}
\begin{description}
\item [\underline{{\it Pride and Prejudice} by Jane Austen}]  \ding{32}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item [{\bf year}] The novel was written between October of 1796 and August of 1797.
	\item [{\bf summary}] Jane Austen’s classic novel chronicles the events in the lives of the Bennet family. Take a family with five unmarried daughters and a lack of wealth, throw in a new wealthy neighbor or two, plus a whole regiment of soldiers in town, and add a heaping spoonful of pride and a pinch of prejudice. Mix it all together and you get a story full of tears and laughter, embarrassment and pride, and, of course, love.

\item [\underline{{\it Emma} by Jane Austen}]  \ding{32}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item [{\bf year}] Austen wrote {\it Emma} between January of 1814 and March of 1815.
	\item [{\bf summary}] Sherry reads Jane Austen’s sparkling comedy of manners with wit and vivacity, and brings the characters to life. Mr. Woodhouse worries and frets, Miss Bates chatters on, and Emma blithely manipulates and misunderstands her friends and family until she finally learns her lesson! 
	\item [{\bf URL}] \url{http://www.online-literature.com/austen/emma/}

\item [\underline{{\it Jane Eyre} by Charlotte Bronte}] \ding{32}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item [{\bf year}] 1847
	\item [{\bf summary}] Jane Eyre is not your typical romance. It is a story of a woman who struggles with a world in which she doesn’t quite fit. Once finished with her schooling, and with no family that really cares for her she strikes out on her own as a governess. Jane Eyre searches for love, someone to care for her, and someone to care for, and finds it in unexpected places.
