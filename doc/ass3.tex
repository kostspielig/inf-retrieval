\chapter{General Questions}

\begin{enumerate}\item We issued five queries in Bing and Google, specifying the wikipedia domain. In order to do this, we used the keyword {\bf site}. Therefore, our queries have the following skeleton, {\it word(s) site: en.wikipedia.org}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{\Roman{enumii}}
			\item \texttt{Tucson Mass Shooting}
			\item \texttt{Manolo Blahnik}
			\item \texttt{Twin Towers}
			\item \texttt{Best tennis player}
			\item \texttt{}
		\end{enumerate}
	Formulating the first query, we wanted to see how accurate the results were. For Google and Bing, we found the first result to be the main article about the shooting. However, as for the second result, only Bing showed an article relating to the Tucson Shooting. Bing not only listed the articles found, but also showed the content of the articles, allowing the user to navigate to a specific one.

	The second query searched for a Spanish shoe designer. The main difference between Google and Bing is that Google showed pictures as a result, while Bing only showed articles. Bing, however, additionally showed the categories to which Manolo Blahnik belongs: {\it canarian people} and {\it shoe designer}.

	The third query searched for the twin towers. We wanted to see if the search engines were going to give us any information about the attacks on September 11, 2001. Google gave the result {\it september 11 attacks} on the 9th position, while Bing did on the 4th. Bing also showed a small group of pictures at the beginning of the search.

	Formulating a very imprecise number four query, both engines in first place link to the ranking pages for tennis players. However, Google also includes famous tennis player, including the one we were looking for: Rafael Nadal in the 7th position.

	\item The articles we found regarding the {\it Tucson Mass Shooting} are:

		\begin{description}
		\item [2011 Tucson shooting] .\\ \\
			\begin{tabular}{| l || l | } \hline
			  {\bf Revisions} & 2886 \\
			  {\bf First Edit} & 08 January 2011, 19:34 \\\hline
			\end{tabular}\\\\
This is the main article that talks about the Tucson shooting. The number of changes that have been made during the 22 days that the article has been alive, suggest about 5.5 revisions per hour.

		\item[Barack Obama Tucson memorial speech].\\\\
			\begin{tabular}{| l || l | } \hline
			  {\bf Revisions} & 137\\
			  {\bf First Edit} & 15 January 2011, 07:05\\	\hline
			\end{tabular} \\\\
	This article was created two days after Obama's speech. Ever since, it has been updated an average of 9 times per day.

		\end{description}

	Based on the results, we feel like the best way to decide how often to visit Wikipedia pages should be based on the number of revisions that the page has.  As for a page with a high number of revisions per hour, such as the first article, we could crawl the page after 10 or more new revisions have been made.
